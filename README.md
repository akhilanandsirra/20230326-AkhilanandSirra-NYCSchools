# JPMC - iOS Coding Challange: NYC Schools
I developed a native iOS application using SwiftUI to showcase information on New York City High Schools. To ensure a robust and scalable architecture, I followed the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern.

To fetch the required data, I implemented an API call using node.js and deployed the node server on Digital Cloud hosting service. This ensured that the application runs smoothly and efficiently with minimal downtime.

To ensure the quality and reliability of the application, I wrote unit test cases that were executed throughout the development process.

To enhance the overall user experience, I implemented light/dark mode, used appropriate animations & designed an appealing app icon using Illustrator that reflects the core features and functionality of the application.
